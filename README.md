# Room.Me

We've heard lots horror stories about bad roommates-- we want to end these horror stories and turn finding a random roommate into finding a friend. Many first-year students at Pitt use Facebook to find roommates, but it is essentially a one-way match-- you can't know that you both are compatible.

When users first log in to the app, they fill out a questionnaire about themselves and about what they are seeking in a roommate. It then presents them with profiles that fit their criteria. Users then can check yes or no, and if both click yes, they're a match. Matches can then exchange contact information.
